Open that folder in Command Prompt and run `copy *.csv run1.csv` to combine them into a single, larger CSV file.


#### Key Points/Questions:

1. Number of articles will vary based on breaches (types/size); some will have a large amount written on them, others almost none
2. Expect a positive correlation in the number of articles by company *size*
3. Expect disproportionate percentage (%) of articles based on sector; potentially more in critical sectors (i.e. health, infrastructure, tech.), less in niche ones (construction, marketing)
4. Number of articles will correlate *more strongly* to number of records breached (severity)
5. Number (sum) of records breached from smaller companies could be larger than that of larger companies, while the number of articles is higher for larger companies regardless (disproportionate reporting/biases/etc. for breach reportage based more on company, not actual breach severity)
