#### Notes:

To get the `run1.csv` file (too large to upload) for the viz used in `run1.py`, navigate to the original folder `/data/run_1/` or copy CSVs from there to another folder. <br />
Open that folder in Command Prompt and run `copy *.csv run1.csv` to combine them into a single, larger CSV file.
